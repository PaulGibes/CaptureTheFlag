# Capture The Flag Game

A game of Capture the Flag can be a quick and simple turnaround or a long battle. Everything depends on the deviousness of the players. That, plus the number of teams and players , will determine the length and competitiveness of a game. You can play with any number of players but usually having at least 4 or more on a side is ideal.

The rules of Capture the Flag are simple. Each team tries to take the other team's flag and get it back to their territory. The game ends when one team gets the other flag to their home base. Learn more about how to play Capture the Flag.
